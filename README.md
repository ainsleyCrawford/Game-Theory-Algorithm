# Game-Theory-Algorithm
Game theory is the study of...

The prisoner's dilemma is ...

Best (better word?) strategy is 'tit-for-tat'...

The aim of this project is to create an algorithm that implements the 'tit-for-tat' strategy against a future user.
A console app will be used for now; the interaction logic could be easily incorporated into WPF at a later date.

Logic:
For the algorithm to respond in kind to the user's most recent action—cooperation/betrayl—that action must be passed
into an if-statement. A boolean seems most adapted for this role.
